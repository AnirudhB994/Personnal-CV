                    I am a first year student learning CSE from Dayananda Sagar college of engineering. Presently I am learning Physics cycle and was about to finish the 1st Sem exams but due to the necessary Covid Lockdown, the exams have been postponed and directly will be directly attending the 2nd sem Chemistry cycle classes.
                    I had registered for the IEDC design team and I am beginner to the design section and still learning it but due to some past experience in handling the events, I also auditioned for the event management Hospitality team and got selected.
                    But all the thngs have got struck due to Covid-19 which we all need to fight unitedly by taking care of self and the others for a healthy community.
